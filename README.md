# Fashion Lifestyle Website

## Description

Welcome to the Fashion Lifestyle website! This project is built using **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** to enhance my knowledge of these technologies. The website showcases a variety of fashion items to improve the user experience. This project serves as a practical example of using modern web development tools to create a responsive and dynamic web application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these instructions:

**Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asme10/fashion-liifestyle.git
cd fashion-liifestyle
```

**Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**Run the Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
